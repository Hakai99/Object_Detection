### 🔍 mAP Comparison: Your Results vs. Official GitHub Results (Faster R-CNN on Pascal VOC 2007)

---

#### ✅ Your mAP Results (After 5 Epochs)
```
Average Precision  (AP) @[IoU=0.50:0.95] = 0.002
Average Precision  (AP) @[IoU=0.50]      = 0.004
Average Precision  (AP) @[IoU=0.75]      = 0.001
Average Recall     (AR) @[IoU=0.50:0.95] = 0.032
```

#### 📊 Expected mAP from GitHub (Trained for 10–12 Epochs)
According to [PyTorch's GitHub benchmarks](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references/detection):
```
AP @[IoU=0.50:0.95] ≈ 0.370 – 0.420
AP @[IoU=0.50]      ≈ 0.600 – 0.700
AP @[IoU=0.75]      ≈ 0.450 – 0.550
Average Recall      ≈ 0.40
```

#### 📌 Conclusion

| Metric        | Your Result | Expected (GitHub) | Status |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|--------|
| AP@[.50:.95]  | 0.002       | 0.37–0.42         | 🔻 Very Low |
| AP@[0.50]     | 0.004       | 0.60–0.70         | 🔻 Very Low |
| AR            | 0.032       | ~0.40             | 🔻 Very Low |

#### ❗️Reasons for Low mAP

1. **Insufficient training (only 5 epochs)** — needs at least 10–12.
2. **Training interrupted or done partially on CPU**, which is slow and inefficient.
3. **Loss is still high (~750)** — model hasn’t converged.
4. **Potential issues in annotations or labels**.

#### ✅ Recommendations

- Train for **12+ epochs** using **Colab GPU (T4/V100)**.
- Resume training from your 5-epoch checkpoint.
- After training, re-run evaluation to improve mAP.
